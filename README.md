This repo contains the RFIC project Reports. They are a part of the course EE6320 RF IC Design at IIT Madras taught by Dr. Sanakran Aniruddhan.
1. Designed a Low Noise Amplifier with 22 dB gain, < 2dB NF, and IIP3 > 0dBm across 925–960MHz.
2. Designed Gilbert cell mixer with 22 dB gain, 0.01 dB gain flatness, NF < 10 dB, and IIP3 > 0dBm.
3. Developed VCO with 75 MHz/V sensitivity, 1.849–1.94 GHz tuning range, and phase noise < –128 dBc/Hz. A divider is used to downscale VCO output to 925–960 MHz as LO for mixer integration.
5. Designed power amplifier with 13 dBm P1dB, < 1.5° AM-PM deviation, and >14.16 voltage gain
